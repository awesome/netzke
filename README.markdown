## Netzke

Netzke is a framework that greatly facilitates creation of Sencha [Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) / [Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) + [Ruby-on-Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) applications by offering you a true component-oriented approach. Using components gives you the following advantages:

* __Reusability__. Write a component once, and use it throughout your application easily, or share it between applications.
* __Composability__. Build new components by combining existing components.
* __Extensibility__. Components are Ruby classes, and can be easily extended using the object-oriented approach.
* __Encapsulation__. You don't need to know JavaScript or Sencha libraries in order to be able to use existing components.

Having these at your disposal, you can quickly build _amazingly_ complex RIA ("Rich Internet Applications") without turning your code into a mess.
