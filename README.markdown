# Netzke

Netzke is a framework that greatly facilitates creation of complex [Sencha Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) + [Ruby-on-Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) applications by leveraging a true component-oriented approach. Choosing for components gives you the following advantages over conventional MVC:

* __Reusability__. Write a component once, and use it throughout your application easily, or share it between applications. Easily reuse third-party components.
* __Composability__. Build new components by combining existing components.
* __Extensibility__. Components are Ruby classes, and can be easily extended using the object-oriented techniques.
* __Encapsulation__. You don't need to know JavaScript or Sencha libraries in order to use existing components; component developers can still use the full power of Sencha Ext JS.

As a result, your code scales much better in the sense of complexity, compared to using conventional MVC, where the developer is pretty limited with programming techniques they can apply. With Netzke, you can quickly build _amazingly_ complex RIA ("Rich Internet Applications") without turning your code into a mess.
