Netzke is a framework that greatly facilitates creation of complex [Sencha Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) + [Ruby-on-Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) applications by leveraging a true modular approach.

* [Project website](http://netzke.org) - a place to start
* [Netzke Core](https://github.com/nomadcoder/netzke-core) - the "bare bones" of the framework. The README is a must-read for understanding the framework.
* [Netzke Basepack](https://github.com/nomadcoder/netzke-basepack) - essential feature-packed pre-built components.
* [Netzke Community-pack](https://github.com/nomadcoder/netzke-communitypack) - community-contributed components.
* [Demo](http://netzke-demo.herokuapp.com) - a demo showing off components from Basepack and Community-pack.
* [Yanit](http://yanit.heroku.com) - Yet Another (Netzke) Issue Tracker, a pretty complex demo application that could be easily written in just a few hours.
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/netzke) - news about Netzke.
